Note that this is not a pure client-server app - because Heroku only allows for one dyno to be used per free account. 
Because of that, the server is running on the dyno (see the start script), and the client is presented by addresing 
the appropriate route on the server. The server is accessing the client code as static content from the build: 
Line 17: 
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'client/build')));
This fires up index.html on the client side.
The client and server are running on different ports; it is hard to see when you are in the Heroku environment, 
everything is encapsulated within a sigle dyno. On the background, however, the client is sending requests and handles 
responses from the server in a pure client-server manner.
